<center><h2>Summary</h2></center>
    
    <p>
      I am an aspiring data analyst, and a web developer. My favorite pass time
      is to learn something and experiment. My technical expertise involve data
      visualization using tableau and R, deriving key insights from a large
      amount of data, and to use SQL to structure it. My broad intersts allow me
      talk about diverse subjects in depth, which supplements my people skills.
      I am currently improving my skills to better equip myself for the age of
      data and A.I. So that I can offer my expertise and insights to a reputable
      firm.
